Important Information:

For the .bmp and .ico files, if one needs to download them for the game, one has to create a folder called Media and put both files in
that folder. Then one has to put the folder in the same location as the executable because the program needs those files mainly for loading the icon. I could not upload the directory because Github would not let me upload the directory, only the files in them.
